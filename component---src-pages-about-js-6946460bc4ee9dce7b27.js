In high school there was a clear path that many of my peers, including me, have taken. You take certain classes, take the SAT/ACT, apply for colleges and you were done. In college however, everything is different. I see some of my friends who have graduated college already, some taking more than the "4 years" for the degree, and some that have dropped out. Everyone is now on a different path pursuing what suits them. I have still yet to find a solid path to take as there are many paths opening up. The current plan at the moment is to secure a job in the industry and graduate. I eventually want to pursue higher studies in business part-time while working.

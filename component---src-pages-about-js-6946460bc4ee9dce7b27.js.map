I am currently 21 years old and love learning new \n              things to better myself and/or others everyday.\n              </p>\n              <h3> Why Computer Science?</h3>\n              <p>\n              I can narrow it down to three major reasons.\n              <br></br> \n              <ul>\n                <li>My dad</li>\n                <li>My high school</li>\n                <li>My passion</li> \n              </ul>\n                Starting with my dad, I have always seen him around computers since I was young. This intrigued me to want to learn more about what he does for a living. \n                Visiting his work environment in high school was eye opening, and that was when I decided to pursue something computer related.\n                <br></br><br></br>\n                School was the next milestone where I took Introduction to Java and AP Computer Science classes at Cupertino High. Taking these courses was challenging but also fun for me. \n                It was then that I knew I wanted to pursue computer science as a major in the future.\n                <br></br><br></br>\n                Lastly, my passion for computer science. Attending many hackathons, working on my own projects, and learning skills on internships, I worked past hardships and wanted to always find solutions to problems. \n                If there was a bug in my project, I would not rest until I figured out what was wrong with my code and how it can be solved. \n              </p>\n              <h3>What now?</h3>\n              <p>\n                Honestly, I do not know for sure and that's okay. In high school there was a clear path that many of my peers, including me, have taken. \n                You take certain classes, take the SAT/ACT, apply for colleges and you were done. In college however, everything is different. \n                I see some of my friends who have graduated college already, some taking more than the \"4 years\" for the degree, and some that have dropped out. \n                Everyone is now on a different path pursuing what suits them. I have still yet to find a solid path to take as there are many paths opening up. \n                The current plan at the moment is to secure a job in the industry and graduate. I eventually want to pursue higher studies in business part-time while working.\n                Wohoo MBA!!\n              </p>\n              \n            </section>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-4 col-12-medium\">\n            <section id=\"sidebar\">\n             \n              <section>\n                <a href=\"#\" className=\"image fit\">\n                  <img src={cutie} alt=\"\" />\n                </a>\n                <p>\n                 Pictured above is the last hackathon I attended with friend Douglas Tran at Cutie Hack 2019.\n                </p>\n               \n              </section>\n            </section>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default LeftSidebar","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/cutieHack-47f107cde3e19dbed9c26d18602f7e9c.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
